              Native Americans called the land of the southeastern U.S their home for the thousands of years before European colonization. One of these tribes was the Catawba people that lived by the Catawba River. Who were these people who ruled over the Southeastern region of the United States before the Europeans invaded and are they still among us?

            <p>
              The Catawba people have an outstanding history worth sharing. Life for the Catawba people changed drastically with the European settlement. They had no immunity to the diseases brought by the Europeans which led to the death of thousands indigenous people. Others were killed, enslaved or, fled which weakened the remaining tribe.

           Early estimates of the Catawba population made by the Spanish explorers in 1540 were between 15,000-25,000. After the settlement from the Englishmen, this started to decimate and by the early 1800&#8216;s numbers were down to only 100 true Catawbas left. </p>

            <h2>Catawba TRIBE LIFESTYLE</h2>
            <div class="col-12 mt-5 mb-5"><p>
              The Catawba people have lived on their ancestral land along the Catawba river for at least 6000 years, some say more than 10,000 years. To get an understanding of how far back we are in time, this is when the culture of farming was introduced in the UK, which was the takeoff of the Neolithic period (New Stone Age). The name of their tribe &#8220;Catawba Indians&#8221; was actually invented by the Europeans, in fact, the tribe called themselves Iswahere, meaning  &#8220;people of the river&#8220;.

                    The early Catawbas lived in villages surrounded by a wooden wall. Just like our cities today, the village had a large council house, sweat lodge, homes and an open plaza for meeting, games and dances.

                    Like everyone during this time, the Catawbas were farmers. The importance of their corn cannot be overemphasized. These crops facilitated life for everyone, providing high nutritious food with minimal expenditure of labor and could be dried and stored for months. The animals were of great importance to the Southeast Native Americans. You could find rabbits, wild hogs, turkeys and deers and the usage of the animals varied within food, clothing, shelter and decorations.

                    The 220 miles long Catawba river is named after the Catawba Tribe that lived by it for more than 6.000 years. The river originates in Western North Carolina and flows into South Carolina. The river's length equals the distance between London Victoria and Liverpool, which takes 4 hours and 17 min to drive by car.

                    Catawbas have specific methods they follow to create their wonderful and popular pottery. This method and many of the clay holes used hundreds of years ago are still used today and have more or less remained the same. Catawba pottery is formed completely by hand and left to dry for several days and is then detailed by rubbing and scraping the piece by hand. When the details are set it will be fired in an open fire. The different colors of the pottery come from the clay along with the variety of wood used and the intensity of the fire. The elegant and simple style is instantly recognizable. This tradition is still carried on to the children of Catawba in their Cultural Center.
